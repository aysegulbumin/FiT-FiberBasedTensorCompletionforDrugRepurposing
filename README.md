# CellsDrugsGenes

I will be keeping log of the set of experiments we have run for this project.

1. Tensor Completion with Matrix Slices(To be added)

2. Tensor Completion with External information

  - External Information as Correlation
  
  - External Information as Equality

2.5 How to access to String Database?
  
   - Which correlation did we use exactly?
   
   - What is our threshold?

3. Tensor Completion with Clustering

4. Tensor Completion with External Information and Clustering

5. Code snippet that shows the connectivity of the genes which are selected based on experimental evidence. (To be added)

6. The experiments that showed the best that we can reach if we used a weighted average.. (To be added)
  - Recall what was the weighted average? 
  - Do we need to mention this in the paper?
